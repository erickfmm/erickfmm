- 👋 Hi, I’m @erickfmm, currently working as a Junior Developer on the Ministry of Education, Chile
- 👀 I’m interested in Backend development, maths, statistics, machine learning, databases and more
- 🌱 I’m currently learning machine learning in its various shapes, specially algorithms that allows to work in efficient ways with not so much data
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any free open source project (or maybe not) that helps developers to be more efficient, and making the world a better place
- 📫 You can reach me here, send me a message or maybe just the life will join us
